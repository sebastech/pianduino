# pianduino

Code runs on an Arduino.  Used breadboard, tactile pushbuttons, and speaker to create a mini-piano.  I was part of a team of 3, and the coding was my responsibility.  Could record music played by keeping track of what buttons were pressed, then play it back to the user exactly how it was played.
